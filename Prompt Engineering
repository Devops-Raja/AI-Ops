🧩 Prompting Best Practices for DevOps AI Agents
1. 🎯 Context-First Prompting

Always provide rich context instead of vague requests.

❌ Bad Example:

Fix my Kubernetes error


✅ Good Example:

Pod payment-service in namespace production showing ImagePullBackOff, 
using ECR registry, k8s 1.28

2. 🗂️ Structured Requests

For complex tasks, follow a structured request format:

Analyze: [what to examine]

Context: [environment details]

Goal: [desired outcome]

Constraints: [limitations/requirements]

👉 Example:

Analyze: Pod startup failures
Context: k8s 1.28, production namespace, ECR images
Goal: Fix ImagePullBackOff error
Constraints: No cluster restarts, minimal downtime

3. 🔄 Iterative Refinement

Break problems into progressive steps:

First:

Check pod status in production


Then:

Show events for failing pods


Finally:

Decode the secret payment-db-secret and verify base64 encoding

4. ✅ Verification Prompting

Always verify before execution to prevent risky actions.

👉 Example:

Show me the command you'll run 
and explain what it does before executing


⚡ Summary:

Provide context

Use structured format

Refine iteratively

Demand verification

This ensures safe, reliable, and efficient collaboration with AI in DevOps workflows.
