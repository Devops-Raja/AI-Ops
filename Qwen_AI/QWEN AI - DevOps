## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Direct CLI Access**  
   - Executes shell commands inside your environment.  
   - Useful for DevOps workflows like deployments, monitoring, and troubleshooting.  

2. **MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol)**  
   - Securely connects Qwen with external systems (APIs, cloud services, databases).  
   - Provides context-aware execution.  

3. **Task-Specific Agents**  
   - Switch between specialized agents:
     - 🖥 **DevOps Agent** → CI/CD, Kubernetes, monitoring.  
     - ⚙️ **Coding Agent** → Write, refactor, and debug code.  
     - ☁️ **Cloud Agent** → AWS, GCP, Azure tasks.  

4. **Adaptive Model Switching**  
   - Dynamically selects between **lightweight** and **advanced** models based on task complexity.

**Qwen Agent Output:**  
```bash
kubectl logs -n prod pod/payment-service-abc123



Qwen is AI tool for learning how to integrate AI powered tools with infrastructure. 
Qwen can easily be substituted with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, or any other CLI tools and frameworks available today.

It is important to remember that using public AI APIs may not be the best use case in production, especially when security is of prime importance. 
These tools are specifically selected for the lab to provide a great experience while you learn the underlying concepts while ensuring fair usage to competent models.
