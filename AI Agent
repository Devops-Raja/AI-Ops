- AI AGENTS which as a devops team member

Need to install the QWEN agents via script.
eg:

echo "Verifying agent installation..."
if [ -f ~/.qwen/agents/docker-optimizer.md ] && [ -f ~/.qwen/agents/terraform-security.md ]; then
    echo "✅ All agents successfully installed!"
    echo ""
    echo "Available agents:"
    echo "  🐳 docker-optimizer    - Optimizes Docker images for ECR"
    echo "  🔒 terraform-security  - Scans Terraform for security issues"
else
    echo "❌ Error: Some agents failed to install"
    exit 1
fi

echo ""
echo "========================================="
echo "Setup Complete!"
===================================================================================================================================================
--> What the Script Does
Creates the ~/.qwen/agents directory
Clears any existing agents to prevent duplicates
Copies the docker-optimizer.md agent file
Copies the terraform-security.md agent file
Verifies successful installation
===================================================================================================================================================
Key points
Subagents are specialists - Each focuses on one domain
Easy to create - Just markdown files with YAML headers
Reusable expertise - Use same agents across all projects
Independent contexts - Agents work without interfering
Automated best practices - Consistent quality every time
================================
